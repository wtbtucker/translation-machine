# Introduction
Automatic translation of languages is helpful for travelers, immigrants, or anyone who wants to communicate with people from another culture. This project seeks to solve the problem of machine translation from English to Spanish.

For this task I will use a sequence-sequence transformer model. A transformer is a neural network that learns context by tracking relationships in sequential data. This context is very useful for automatic translation of text. [5]
